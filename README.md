# UX
## Target Audience
The site is mainly targeted toward fitness enthusiasts living in rural areas, but the broader target audience is all adults.  The site aims to be welcoming and informal yet professional, with class descriptions being fun and engaging to draw in new members.
 
## Project Goals and Planning
The goal of the project was to create a user-friendly exercise class booking system, to display database management skills and proficiency in the Django framework. The site aims to make the booking process as intuitive and smooth as possible, with clear feedback given to the user at each stage.
### Database Schema
To plan the structure of the database, the below schema was created. The Activity model is the base model, with the Session model inheriting values from it via a foreign key. The Booking model uses the Session model as a foreign key.

## User Stories
The project followed an agile methodology and implemented Issues on GitHub, which were aligned with the project's User stories. Details of the acceptance criteria of each user story can be found in [TESTING.MD](https://github.com/AlexSmall96/Rural-Fitness/blob/main/TESTING.md).
### Gym / Club Member

## Programming Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries used
- HTML
- CSS, Javascript
    - The Bootstrap framework was used, mainly for its grid system. Several pages use buttons, modals, and tabs via Bootstrap.
- Python
    - The Django framework formed the basis of this project. It was used to create data models and to pass information back between the browser and the database. 
    - The DateTime Python library was used to record the current date to load the correct data into the timetable, members area, and admin pages.
## Other programs used 
- [CSV to JSON](https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm) was used to convert the timetable data from Excel into JSON format for loading into the database.

2. Create a new database instance on Elephant SQL and copy the database URL
3. Create an account on [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) and log in.
4. Create a new app on Heroku
5. Navigate to the 'Settings' tab, and click "Reveal Config Vars".
6. Add a config var with key DATABASE_URL and value equal to the database URL you copied from elephantSQL
7. Create an account on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/users/login) and upload all files in the static folder of this repository
8. Copy Cloudinary URL.
9. Add another config var with key CLOUDINARY_URL and value of the Cloudinary URL you copied.
10. Add a final config var with key SECRET_KEY and set it to a chosen value.
11. Navigate to the 'Deployment' tab. For 'Deployment method', select Github.
12. Under 'Search for a repository to connect to, enter the appropriate GitHub username and repository name
13. To deploy the repository, either select 'Enable Automatic Deploys', which deploys the site after each push to GitHub, or Manually click 'Deploy Branch'
14. In both deployment methods, the main branch or any forked branches may be chosen, see [Forking the Repository on Github](#Forking-the-Repository-on-GitHub)

### Forking the Repository on GitHub
